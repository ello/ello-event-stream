# Ello.EventStream (WIP)

Library for reading and writing to the Ello event stream.

Ello uses the AWS Kinesis service to publish events for multiple services to
consume. Events are published as Apach Avro serialized OCF files.

This library is a common library that can be used by our Elixir applications
to both publish to and read from the event stream.

## Code of Conduct
Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all
human beings is to be kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, and
respectful of others. To that end, we will be enforcing
[the Ello rules](https://ello.co/wtf/policies/rules/) within all of our open
source projects. If you donâ€™t follow the rules, you risk being ignored, banned,
or reported for abuse.
